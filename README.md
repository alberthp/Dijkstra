# Dijkstra

Computation of the Dijkstra minimum cost path. Based on Google Colab 

The program has two main parts:

## Part 1: 
Automagtic generation and visualization of Graph, including Nodes, Connections and Costs associated to each.

Users can generate new graphs based on the JSON example provided at the fist part or use the automatic generator.

NOTE: The "Process Dijkstra" button is stil not working. Manual execution of the code block is required once the graph is defined.

## Part 2:
Computation of the Dijkstra minimum cost path. 

* At each step, the program shows the graph with the nodes and the table
* At the end of the computation, it shows the resulting tables with the computation
