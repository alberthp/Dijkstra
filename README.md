# Dijkstra computation for a network of routers

## Description

Computation of the Dijkstra minimum cost paths between origin node and all rest of nodes in a network of routers. 

Developed as illustrative example for Networks topic in Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF).

The program shows the graph generated by the routers (nodes) and communication links between them (links). The graph is non-directional.
Then, shows all the updated information of each algorithm iteration, including the table with minimum distances and computed min cost nodes and the graph illustrating the status of the computation.

## Program development
* Developed using Python 3
* Based on Google Colab 

## Graph generation and Dijkstra computation

The program has two separated parts:
1. Graph generation
2. Dijkstra min cost computation

Graphs are defined using JSON file following this format:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The graph is non-directional, even JSON explicites "source" and "destination"

<pre><code>
network_data = {
  "nodes": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "A", "destination": "B", "cost": 2},
    {"source": "A", "destination": "C", "cost": 4},
    {"source": "B", "destination": "C", "cost": 1},
    {"source": "B", "destination": "D", "cost": 7},
    {"source": "C", "destination": "E", "cost": 3},
    {"source": "D", "destination": "E", "cost": 1}
  ],
  "start_node": "A"
}
</code></pre>

Automagtic generation and visualization of Graph, including Nodes, Connections and Costs associated to each.

### Manual graph definition
Graph can be generated manually following the JSON format previously shown. 

1. Create a new code cell.
2. Generate the new graph with name "network_data".
3. Do not execute "Generation of a network" to avoid overwriting the created graph.
4. Execute "Computation of Dijkstra" code cell

### Automatic graph definition
A random graph can be generated automatically using the "Generation of a network" code cell

#### Step 1
Define the number of nodes. The connections and costs are randomly generated

  <img src="/images/GraphGen01.png" alt="Graph Initialization">
  <br>
  Graph initialization after indicating the number of nodes
</p>

#### Step 2
The program will show the generated graph

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/GraphGen02.png" alt="Graph Initialization" width="500">
  <br>
  Graph visualization, including nodes, connections and costs
</p>



And will request for the initial node

  Selection of initial node
</p>

> [!WARNING]  
> The "Process Dijkstra" button is stil not working. Manual execution of the code block is required once the graph is defined.


## Part 2:
Computation of the Dijkstra minimum cost path. 

* At each step, the program shows the graph with the nodes and the table

* At the end of the computation, it shows the resulting tables with the computation
